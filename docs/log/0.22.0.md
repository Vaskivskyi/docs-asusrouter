## 🚀 Features

- Improved SSDP discovery:
    - Ignore devices with no serial number available
    - Discovery is now based on FW instead of the manufacturer (only discover AsusWRT-powered devices)
- Improved configuration and options flow:
    - Block multiple setups for a single serial number
    - Configurable options are now sorted into a menu
    - Allow to set up integration with no options (integration can now be setup in 3 short steps)
    - Sorted options to be better grouped
    - When credentials are not changed, the check will be now skipped (to minimize the number of connections)
