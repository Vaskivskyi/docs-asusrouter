# 0.16.0 🎁 Many small improvements

`2022-12-25`

## 🚀 Features

- Improved hiding of protected values from the entities attributes
- Security-protected attributes are hidden from the `binary_sensor` entities
- Move all the `control`/`no-control` features from the library to the integration
- The confirmation step is removed from the options flow as obsolete - there is no need anymore to manually reload the integration after changing its settings

## 🐛 Bug fixes

- Fixed `Device is connected in no-control mode. Sending commands is blocked` when in no-control mode, raised by the `update` entity.
- Fixed bug with missing timemaps in parental control rules (report [#369](https://github.com/Vaskivskyi/ha-asusrouter/issues/369))

## 💥 Breaking

- Services `asusrouter.adjust_wlan` and `asusrouter.device_internet_access` are available only in `control` mode of the integration - which would be the correct expected behaviour.

## 📦 Dependencies

- Bump `asusrouter` library to [`0.15.0`](https://github.com/Vaskivskyi/asusrouter/releases/tag/0.15.0) -> [`0.15.1`](https://github.com/Vaskivskyi/asusrouter/releases/tag/0.15.1)

## 🔨 Other changes

- Simplified obtaining of `temperature` sensors list from the backend
- Simplified code for static entities
- Simplified generation of the static entities
- Improved constants usage
