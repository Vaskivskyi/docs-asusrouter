# 0.15.0 🌡️ More temperatures and fixes

`2022-12-18`

## 💣 Known issues

- Updating to this version might disable your current temperature sensors and create the new ones. In this case, please remove the old entities, enable the new ones and assign them entity_id's as before.

## 🔒 Requirements

- Minimum Home Assistant version bumped to `2022.11.0`

## 🚀 New features

- New `guest_id` integer attribute added to the device identities (and `device_tracker` entities), which shows the number of guest WLAN (e.g. `1`, `2` or `3` when connected or `0` when not connected to a guest network)
- Added support for the temperature of `5 GHz-2` and `6 GHz` wireless modules (device and firmware dependant)

## 🐛 Bug fixes

- `guest` binary attribute of `device_tracker` entities fixed (reports [#C294](https://community.home-assistant.io/t/custom-component-asusrouter-integration/416111/294?u=vaskivskyi), [#384](https://github.com/Vaskivskyi/ha-asusrouter/issues/384))

## 💥 Breaking

- Deprecated in [0.13.0](/log/0.13.0) `entity_id`, `mac` and `name` parameters of `asusrouter.device_internet_access` service are removed
- Migration from versions 0.5.1 and lower is removed - consider the [new migration FAQ](/guide/faq/#migration-from-an-old-version) if you need to update from an older version
