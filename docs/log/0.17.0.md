`2023-01-08`

#### [→ 🐙 GitHub change log ←](https://github.com/Vaskivskyi/ha-asusrouter/releases/tag/0.17.0)

## 🔒 Requirements

- Minimum Home Assistant version bumped to `2023.1.0`

## 🚀 Features

- Devices:
    - Added device modes (`Router` or `AiMesh node`) which can be selected during initial integration configuration or via `Configure` option on the Integrations page
    - Devices in `Router` mode support all the features of AsusRouter
    - Devices in `AiMesh node` mode support the following feature groups: `Main`, `CPU`, `LED`, `Load average`, `Network`, `Ports`, `RAM`, `Temperature`. Other features are disabled as unreliable / duplicating
- Added AiMesh support (FW: `386.x+` only, [details](/features/aimesh.html)):
    - Wireless backhaul
    - Wired backhaul
    - Node status `binary_sensor` entities
    - Node devices
    - Node-related events: `asusrouter_node_connected`, `asusrouter_node_disconnected`, `asusrouter_node_reconnected`
    - `via_device` attribute for the node devices
    - AiMesh data is updated at the same rate as connected devices
- Added node MAC to the connected device identity
- Adjusted entities attributes to be sorted alphabetically in the frontend (except for some default attributes of `device_tracker` entities)
- Improved generation of unique IDs
- Network interfaces are renamed to more obvoius names (`WLAN0` -> `2.4 GHz`, `WLAN1` -> `5 GHz` and so on). `entity_id` will stay as they are if already in use. For new users, `entity_id` will have new naming

## 🐛 Bug fixes

- Added new API endpoint to monitor online status - device trackers should become more reliable (FW: `386.x+` only)
- Fixed naming of temperature sensors after bug in [`0.15.0`](/log/0.15.0.html)
- Fixed `Platform asusrouter does not generate unique IDs.`
- Fixed problems with unique IDs for multiple devices setup
- Fixed events options

## 📖 Translations

- A new string `Device mode` was added to the configuration flow (in respect to the new device modes implemented). It still requires the following translations: `cs`, `es`, `fr`, `nl`, `pt-BR`, `sk`. You can translate it on lines `18`, `31` and `111` of the corresponding traslation file (marked with `[NT]` as `Not Translated`)
- A string was updated from `Device trackers update` to `Devices / AiMesh update` to signify thew same time interval for all the devices. Requires translations: `cs`, `es`, `fr`, `nl`, `pt-BR`, `sk`. Lines `49` and `141`
- New strings added for node events. Missing `cs`, `es`, `fr`, `nl`, `pt-BR`, `sk`. Lines `175:177`

## 📚 Documentation

- Added scripts for automatic generation of devices and available features
- Updated compatible devices list
- Updated feature list to show which of features are available in which device mode

## 📦 Dependencies

- Bumped `asusrouter` library to [`0.16.0`](https://github.com/Vaskivskyi/asusrouter/releases/tag/0.16.0)

## 🔨 Other changes

- Switched to `UnitOfDataRate` enum (`>= 2023.1.0`)
- Switched to `UnitOfInformation` enum (`>= 2023.1.0`)
