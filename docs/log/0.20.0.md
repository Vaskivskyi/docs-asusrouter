# 0.20.0 🌵 Port Status

`2023-02-12`

#### [→ 🐙 GitHub change log ←](https://github.com/Vaskivskyi/ha-asusrouter/releases/tag/0.20.0)

## ⚠️ Deprecation warning

- Sensors `lan_speed` and `wan_speed` are deprecated. They will be removed in version 0.22.0. Please, use the new sensors `port_status_lan` and `port_status_wan`

## 🚀 Features

- Added new Port status sensors (LAN - `port_status_lan`, USB - `port_status_usb`, WAN - `port_status_wan`), reporting more information on the physical ports connections. The feature is fully supported by FW version `388.x`. With older versions, new sensors might reflect fewer data (mimicking deprecated `lan_speed` and `wan_speed` sensors with the new format). [More details on the new features](/features/ports.html#device-port-status-port-type)
