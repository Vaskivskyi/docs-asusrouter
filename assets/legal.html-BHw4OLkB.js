The Integration is designed to provide the user with the ability to monitor and control the devices using the Home Assistant ecosystem (further, HA). To use the Integration, the user is required to provide the Integration with the credentials to access the devices. The credentials are stored in the HA instance directly and cannot be accessed by the Integration without an explicit call from the HA instance.</p><p>When set up by the user, the Integration provides the HA instance with the following sensitive data: device serial number and MAC address(es), which is required to identify the device uniquely within the HA. During the operation, the Integration provides the HA with the data chosen by the user. The user can enable or disable separate types of data via the Integration configuration in HA. Any device data is stored in the HA instance database if defined by the user or the HA instance configuration.</p><div align="center" style="font-size:x-large;"><a href="https://github.com/Vaskivskyi/ha-asusrouter/issues/new" target="_blank">-=Report HA security issue=-</a></div><h2 id="device-description" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#device-description"><span>Device description</span></a></h2><p>The Project collects general device information (hardware and software specifications, available features, device images, etc.):</p><ul><li>from the devices available to the Project maintainers</li><li>from the user&#39;s reports and feedback, voluntarily provided to the Project</li><li>from the publicly available official Asus website and documentation</li><li>from other publicly available sources, including but not limited to news articles, online stores and forums</li></ul><p>The Project aims to provide the user with the most accurate and up-to-date information about the devices.

The Emulator does not store any sensitive information and uses randomized data based on the selected device model and firmware version. The accuracy of the Emulator is not guaranteed and might differ from the real device behavior.</p><div align="center" style="font-size:x-large;"><a href="https://github.com/Vaskivskyi/asusrouter-emulator/issues/new" target="_blank">-=Report emulator issue=-</a></div>',26)])])}const d=t(s,[["render",o]]),l=JSON.parse('{"path":"/legal.html","title":"Legal disclaimer","lang":"en-US","frontmatter":{},"git":{"createdTime":1769328392000,"updatedTime":1769328392000,"contributors":[{"name":"dependabot[bot]","username":"dependabot[bot]","email":"49699333+dependabot[bot]@users.noreply.github.com","commits":2,"url":"https://github.com/dependabot[bot]"}]},"readingTime":{"minutes":2.6,"words":779},"filePathRelative":"legal.md"}');export{d as comp,l as data};
